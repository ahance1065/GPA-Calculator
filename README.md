# GPA Calculator

## Overview
This C++ program calculates a student's GPA based on their course grades and credit hours. It follows the GPA calculation method outlined by the University of North Texas (UNT) Student Success Advising.

## How It Works
The GPA is calculated using the following steps:
1. Multiply the grade value of each course by its corresponding credit hours.
2. Sum the total grade points.
3. Divide the cumulative grade points by the total attempted credit hours.

## Key Terms (Source: The University of North Texas)
- **Credit Hours**: The number of hours assigned to a course, typically ranging from 1 to 5 hours.
- **Grade Value**: The numerical equivalent of a letter grade:
  - A = 4.0

  - D = 1.0
  - F = 0.0
- **Grade Points**: The product of the grade value and the credit hours for a course.
- **Attempted Hours**: Credit hours for which a grade is earned (excluding I's, P/NP, or W's).
