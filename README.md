# üíØ GPA Calculator üî†

## Overview
This C++ program calculates students' GPAs based on their course grades and credit hours. It follows the GPA calculation method outlined by the University of North Texas (UNT) Student Success Advising (This is on a 4.0 scale).

## How It Works
The GPA is calculated using the following steps:
1. Multiply the grade value of each course by its corresponding credit hours.
2. Sum the total grade points.
3. Divide the cumulative grade points by the total attempted credit hours.

## Key Terms (Source: The University of North Texas üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è)
- **Credit Hours**: The number of hours assigned to a course, typically ranging from 1 to 5 hours.
- **Grade Value**: The numerical equivalent of a letter grade:
  - A = 4.0
  - B = 3.0
  - C = 2.0
  - D = 1.0
  - F = 0.0
- **Grade Points**: The product of the grade value and the credit hours for a course.
- **Attempted Hours**: Credit hours for which a grade is earned (excluding I's, P/NP, or W's).
- **Earned Hours**: Credit hours passed with a grade of D or higher.

## Getting Started
### Running the program
**I added the text file to the repository, you can download that to have the code.**
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (you can find some online to speed up the process):
   ```sh
   g++ gpa_calculator.cpp -o gpa_calculator
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   g++ gpa_calculator.cpp -o gpa_calculator
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your grades and credit hours.
4. The program will output your calculated GPA.
